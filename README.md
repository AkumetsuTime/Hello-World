# Hello-World
Just for messing around to try things out<br/>
Ignore everything, nothing useful will be here
<b>How much html does this support?</b> <table><tr><td> Is this an html file?</td><td>  I'm curious now....</td></tr></table>
so it defaults to a bordered table, slightly different from normal html...I think
<br/> .md should be different, I'm gonna look this up
